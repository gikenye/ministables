# Minilend


Minilend is a  savings & lending protocol that enables users to save & borrow various stablecoins with robust compliance mechanisms powered by zkSelf.

## Overview

Minilend addresses the challenge of accessible, compliant lending in decentralized finance by providing a platform where users can:

- Borrow stablecoins using other stablecoins as collateral
- Convert fiat savings to stablecoins and earn interest.
- Swap between different stablecoins
- Maintain regulatory compliance through zkSelf identity verification

## Key Features

- **Multi-Stablecoin Support**: Compatible with various stablecoins on the Celo, Base and Scroll networks
- **Compliance-First Approach**: Integration with zkSelf for KYC/AML compliance
- **Oracle-Based Pricing**: Reliable price feeds through SortedOracles
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern React/Next.js frontend for seamless interaction
- **Proof of Human Verification**: Protection against bot manipulation

## Architecture

Minilend consists of the following core components:

### Smart Contracts

- **Minilend.sol**: Main lending protocol contract that handles borrowing, lending, and interest rate calculations
- **MiniMentoSwapStables.sol**: Facilitates swapping between different stablecoins
- **MockSortedOracles.sol**: Provides price feed data for supported assets
- **ProofOfHuman.sol**: Implements human verification to prevent bot manipulation

### Frontend

Built with Next.js and React, featuring:
- Wallet connection (MetaMask support)
- Dashboard for monitoring positions
- Modals for borrowing, lending, and repayment
